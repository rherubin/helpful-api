# Program Unlock Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented a program unlock feature that tracks user engagement and automatically unlocks access to the next program when a configurable threshold is met.

## Implementation Date
October 21, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`models/Program.js`)

#### New Fields Added to Programs Table
- `steps_required_for_unlock` (INT, DEFAULT 7): Configurable threshold for unlocking
- `next_program_unlocked` (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT FALSE): Unlock status flag
- Added index on `next_program_unlocked` for query performance

#### Migration Support
- Implemented `migrateUnlockFields()` method to automatically add columns to existing databases
- Uses `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` to check for existing columns before attempting migration
- Gracefully handles errors if columns already exist

### 2. Program Model Methods (`models/Program.js`)

#### New Methods
1. **`getStepsWithMessages(programId)`**
   - Returns count of program steps that have at least one message
   - Uses `COUNT(DISTINCT ps.id)` with INNER JOIN on messages table
   - Essential for tracking progress toward unlock threshold

2. **`checkAndUpdateUnlockStatus(programId)`**
   - Checks if unlock threshold has been met
   - Automatically updates `next_program_unlocked` to TRUE when threshold is reached
   - Returns detailed status including steps completed and threshold
   - Optimized to skip checking if already unlocked
   - Logs unlock events to console for monitoring

#### Updated Methods
1. **`createProgram(userId, programData)`**
   - Now accepts `steps_required_for_unlock` parameter (default: 7)
   - Inserts unlock fields into database on program creation
   - Returns unlock fields in response

2. **`getUserPrograms(userId)`**
   - Updated SELECT query to include `steps_required_for_unlock` and `next_program_unlocked`
   - All program lists now include unlock status

3. **`getProgramById(programId)`**
   - Updated SELECT query to include unlock fields
   - Individual program fetches show current unlock status

### 3. Route Updates (`routes/programSteps.js`)

#### Removed Endpoints
- **DELETE**: `GET /api/programs/:programId/programSteps/day/:day` (line 277-308)
- **DELETE**: `POST /api/programs/:programId/programSteps/day/:day` (line 311-354)
- These were redundant with the step ID-based endpoints

#### Updated Endpoint
- **`POST /api/programSteps/:id/messages`** (line 194-241)
  - Added automatic unlock status check after message creation
  - Runs in background with 500ms delay to ensure message is saved
  - Wrapped in try-catch to prevent unlock errors from affecting message creation
  - Maintains existing therapy response trigger functionality

### 4. Test Suite (`tests/program-unlock-test.js`)

Created comprehensive test suite with 5 test scenarios:

1. **Test 1: Default Unlock Threshold**
   - Verifies programs are created with default threshold of 7
   - Confirms `next_program_unlocked` starts as FALSE

2. **Test 2: Custom Unlock Threshold**
   - Tests creating programs with custom thresholds (e.g., 3, 100)
   - Validates threshold is stored and retrieved correctly

3. **Test 3: Unlock Status Progression**
   - Adds messages to program steps incrementally
   - Verifies program remains locked until threshold is met
   - Confirms automatic unlock when 7th step receives a message

4. **Test 4: Pairing Unlock**
   - Tests unlock with two users in a pairing
   - Verifies both users' messages count toward unlock
   - Creates program with custom threshold of 3 for faster testing
   - Confirms unlock with combined contributions

5. **Test 5: Edge Cases**
   - Tests threshold of 0 (immediate unlock)
   - Tests very high thresholds (100)
   - Validates system handles edge cases gracefully

### 5. Documentation (`README.md`)

#### Updated Sections

1. **Programs Table Schema** (line 974-998)
   - Added `steps_required_for_unlock` and `next_program_unlocked` fields
   - Documented default values and purpose
   - Added index documentation

2. **Create Program Endpoint** (line 556-585)
   - Added `steps_required_for_unlock` parameter to request body
   - Updated response examples to include unlock fields
   - Added notes explaining the parameter

3. **Get Programs Endpoints** (line 587-651)
   - Updated all response examples to include unlock fields
   - Shows unlock status in program lists and individual fetches

4. **New Section: Program Unlock Feature** (line 664-710)
   - Comprehensive explanation of how the feature works
   - Key features and benefits
   - Example usage with code snippets
   - Use cases for different scenarios

5. **Updated Program Steps Section** (line 712-729)
   - Added "Unlock Integration" to key features
   - Noted that adding messages automatically updates unlock status

## How It Works

### Automatic Unlock Flow
1. User adds a message to any program step via `POST /api/programSteps/:id/messages`
2. Message is saved to database
3. Background process (500ms delay) calls `checkAndUpdateUnlockStatus(programId)`
4. System queries database to count steps with at least one message
5. If count >= `steps_required_for_unlock`, updates `next_program_unlocked` to TRUE
6. Unlock status is immediately visible in subsequent program fetches

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Automatic vs Manual**: Chose automatic checking on message creation for better UX
2. **Threshold Location**: Stored on program record (not pairing) so any user's contribution counts
3. **Persistent State**: Once unlocked, status remains true even if messages are deleted
4. **Background Processing**: Unlock check runs asynchronously to not slow down message creation
5. **Error Isolation**: Unlock errors don't affect message creation success

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Run the test suite: `node tests/program-unlock-test.js`
3. Verify all 5 tests pass

### Integration with Existing Tests
The feature integrates seamlessly with existing test suites:
- `tests/therapy-response-integration-test.js` - Can verify unlock during message flow
- `tests/pairings-endpoint-test.js` - Can verify pairing unlock scenarios

## API Changes Summary

### New Request Parameters
- `POST /api/programs`: Optional `steps_required_for_unlock` (INT, default 7)

### New Response Fields
All program responses now include:
- `steps_required_for_unlock` (INT)
- `next_program_unlocked` (BOOLEAN)

### Removed Endpoints
- `GET /api/programs/:programId/programSteps/day/:day`
- `POST /api/programs/:programId/programSteps/day/:day`

## Database Migration

### For Existing Databases
The migration runs automatically on server startup:
1. Checks if columns exist using `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`
2. Adds `steps_required_for_unlock` column if missing (default 7)
3. Adds `next_program_unlocked` column if missing (default FALSE)
4. Creates index on `next_program_unlocked`
5. Logs migration progress to console

### No Manual Migration Required
- Existing programs will have default values (7 steps, unlocked=false)
- No data loss or downtime required
- Backward compatible with existing API clients

## Performance Considerations

1. **Index on next_program_unlocked**: Enables fast queries for unlocked programs
2. **Background Processing**: Unlock check doesn't block message creation response
3. **Early Exit**: Skips checking if program is already unlocked
4. **Efficient Query**: Uses COUNT(DISTINCT) with INNER JOIN for step counting

## Monitoring

The system logs unlock events:
```
Program {programId} unlocked! {count}/{threshold} steps completed.
```

Monitor these logs to track user engagement and unlock patterns.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:
1. Add webhook/notification when program unlocks
2. Track unlock timestamp in database
3. Add analytics endpoint for unlock statistics
4. Support for multiple unlock tiers (bronze/silver/gold)
5. Unlock history tracking for audit purposes

## Files Modified

1. `/models/Program.js` - Database schema and business logic
2. `/routes/programSteps.js` - Message creation integration
3. `/tests/program-unlock-test.js` - New test suite
4. `/README.md` - API documentation

## Backward Compatibility

âœ… Fully backward compatible:
- Existing API clients work without changes
- Optional parameter doesn't break existing requests
- New fields in responses are additive
- Migration is automatic and non-destructive
