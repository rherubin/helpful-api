# Helpful API

A comprehensive Node.js REST API with SQLite backend featuring user management, JWT authentication, a flexible pairing system, AI-generated therapy programs with structured program steps, and efficient combined endpoints for optimal client performance.

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **User Management**: Create, update, and retrieve users with secure password authentication
- **JWT Authentication**: Secure login with access and refresh tokens
- **Combined Profile Endpoint**: Single API call for complete user state (profile + pairings + requests)
- **Unified Pairing System**: Request, accept, and reject pairings with partner codes
- **AI Therapy Programs**: OpenAI-generated couples therapy programs with structured daily exercises
- **Program Steps**: Day-based program steps for each program with message threading

### Advanced Features  
- **Smart Pairing Responses**: Pending requests show `partner: null`, accepted pairings show full partner data
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable limits (1000 req/15min general, 100 req/15min login)
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 95+ tests across multiple test suites with 100% success rates
- **Password Security**: Bcrypt hashing with strict password requirements (uppercase, lowercase, number, special char)
- **Token Management**: Short-lived access tokens (15min) with long-lived refresh tokens (7 days)
- **Database Integrity**: SQLite with automatic schema creation and proper JOIN handling
- **RESTful Design**: Clean, consistent API with comprehensive error handling and status codes

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory (optional):
   ```
   PORT=9000
   NODE_ENV=development
   JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-change-in-production
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-refresh-secret-key-change-in-production
   JWT_EXPIRES_IN=1h
   JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRES_IN=7d
   DATABASE_PATH=./helpful-db.sqlite
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-for-therapy-content
   ```

3. **Database Setup** (Automatic):
   
   The SQLite database (`helpful-db.sqlite`) will be created automatically when you first start the server. The application will:
   - Create the database file if it doesn't exist
   - Initialize all required tables (users, refresh_tokens, pairings, programs, program_steps)
   - Set up proper indexes and constraints
   - Automatically migrate existing databases to support new features
   
   **Note**: Database files are excluded from version control. Each developer gets a clean database on first run.
   
   **Development Tips**:
   - To reset your database: Stop the server, delete `helpful-db.sqlite`, then restart
   - First user created will have ID and pairing code generated automatically
   - All tables and schemas are created automatically - no manual SQL needed

4. Start the server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or for development with auto-restart:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Pairing System

**New Pairing Flow**: The pairing system now uses a two-step process:
1. **Request**: A user creates a temporary partner code without specifying who they want to pair with
2. **Accept**: Another user uses that partner code to pair with the original user

This makes pairing more flexible since you don't need to know the other person's pairing code in advance.

#### Request Pairing
- **POST** `/api/pairing/request`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`
- **Body:** No body required
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Partner code generated successfully. Share this code with someone to pair with you.",
    "partner_code": "ABC123",
    "pairing_id": "pairing_id",
    "requester": {
      "id": "user_id",
      "first_name": "John",
      "last_name": "Doe",
      "email": "john.doe@example.com"
    },
    "expires_note": "This partner code is valid until someone uses it or you cancel the request."
  }
  ```
  **Note**: This generates a temporary partner code that others can use to pair with you. The response includes your information so you can share it along with the partner code.

#### Accept Pairing Request
- **POST** `/api/pairing/accept`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`
- **Body:**
  ```json
  {
    "partner_code": "ABC123"
  }
  ```
  **Note**: Use the partner code that someone shared with you to pair with them.
- **Response:** `200 OK` (empty response body)
  
  **Note**: On successful pairing acceptance, only a 200 status code is returned. Use the "Get Accepted Pairings" endpoint to retrieve pairing details if needed.

#### Reject Pairing Request
- **POST** `/api/pairing/reject/:pairingId`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Pairing rejected successfully",
    "pairing_id": "pairing_id"
  }
  ```

#### Get User's Pairings (All - Accepted & Pending)
- **GET** `/api/pairings`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`
- **Description:** Returns all pairings for the authenticated user, including both accepted pairings and pending pairing requests
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "User pairings retrieved successfully",
    "pairings": [
      {
        "id": "accepted_pairing_id",
        "status": "accepted",
        "partner_code": "ABC123",
        "created_at": "2025-01-20T10:30:00.000Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-01-20T10:35:00.000Z",
        "partner": {
          "id": "partner_user_id",
          "first_name": "Jane",
          "last_name": "Doe",
          "email": "jane.doe@example.com"
        }
      },
      {
        "id": "pending_pairing_id",
        "status": "pending",
        "partner_code": "XYZ789",
        "created_at": "2025-01-20T10:45:00.000Z",
        "updated_at": "2025-01-20T10:45:00.000Z",
        "partner": null
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

**Note**: This endpoint now returns both accepted pairings and pending pairing requests in a single response, sorted by creation date (most recent first). For pending partner code requests, the `partner` field will be `null` until someone accepts the code. Only partner information is returned (not your own user data).

#### Get Pending Pairings
- **GET** `/api/pairing/pending`
- **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer {access_token}`
- **Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "message": "Pending pairings retrieved successfully",

### Programs

Programs are AI-generated couples therapy programs that can be created with or without pairings. Each program contains structured daily exercises designed to help couples improve their relationship. When a program is created, OpenAI automatically generates personalized content based on the user's input.

**Key Features:**
- **AI-Generated Content**: Each program contains 14 days of structured exercises
- **Flexible Pairing**: Programs can be created independently or linked to pairings
- **Automatic Conversation Creation**: Each program day gets its own conversation thread
- **Privacy Protection**: Sensitive fields are excluded from list endpoints

**Privacy Note**: The `user_input` and `pairing_id` fields are returned in the POST creation response and the individual `GET /api/programs/:id` response. The list endpoint `GET /api/programs` excludes these fields for privacy protection.

### Program Steps

The program steps system allows users to engage with each day of their therapy program. When a program is created, each day automatically gets its own program step containing the AI-generated exercise content. Users can then add their own messages to discuss their progress, experiences, and reflections for each specific day.

**Key Features:**
- **Day-Based Organization**: Each program day (1-14) has its own program step
- **AI Content Integration**: Each day's theme, conversation starter, and science explanation are stored as program steps
- **Background Therapy Responses**: Automatic AI-powered therapeutic guidance when both users engage
- **Separate Message Storage**: Each message is stored as a separate database record for better organization
- **User Participation**: Both users in a pairing can contribute messages to any day's program step
- **Message Management**: Users can add, edit, and view their own messages
- **Progress Tracking**: Messages can include metadata to track exercise completion and engagement
- **Access Control**: Only program owners and paired users can access program steps

**Database Structure:**
- **Program Steps Table**: Stores day-level metadata (theme, conversation starter, science explanation)
- **Messages Table**: Stores individual messages within program steps with full user tracking

## Background Therapy Response System

The API includes an intelligent background therapy response system that automatically provides therapeutic guidance when both users in a pairing engage in conversation. This feature uses advanced AI to deliver contextual, personalized therapy insights based on Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT) and Gottman Method principles.

### How It Works

1. **Trigger Condition**: When both users in a pairing have posted at least one message to a program step
2. **Timing**: Activates 2 seconds after the second user posts their first message
3. **Non-Blocking**: Runs in the background without affecting API response times
4. **AI Processing**: Uses OpenAI GPT to generate therapeutic responses based on both users' messages
5. **System Messages**: Responses are stored as system messages (up to 3 per trigger)

### Therapeutic Approach

The AI responses are designed using evidence-based couples therapy methods:

- **Emotionally Focused Therapy (EFT)**: Primary therapeutic framework focusing on emotional connection
- **Gottman Method**: Complementary techniques for relationship strengthening
- **Personalized Guidance**: Responses reference specific user names and message content
- **Progressive Support**: Each response builds on the program step context

### Example Therapy Response Flow

```json
{
  "step_messages": [
    {
      "id": "msg1",
      "message_type": "user_message",
      "sender": "Steve",
      "content": "I feel like we've grown apart over the years. I miss the closeness we used to have."
    },
    {
      "id": "msg2", 
      "message_type": "user_message",
      "sender": "Becca",
      "content": "I feel the same way. I want us to find our way back to each other."
    },
    {
      "id": "sys1",
      "message_type": "system",
      "sender_id": null,
      "content": "Thank you both for sharing your feelings with me. I can hear the longing in both of your voices for deeper connection.",
      "metadata": {
        "type": "therapy_response",
        "sequence": 1,
        "total_messages": 3
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "sys2",
      "message_type": "system", 
      "sender_id": null,
      "content": "Steve, when you shared that you miss the closeness you used to have, what emotions were you experiencing in that moment?",
      "metadata": {
        "type": "therapy_response",
        "sequence": 2,
        "total_messages": 3
      }
    },
    {
      "id": "sys3",
      "message_type": "system",
      "sender_id": null, 
      "content": "Becca, your response shows such openness to rebuilding that bond together. Can you help us understand what finding your way back means to you?",
      "metadata": {
        "type": "therapy_response",
        "sequence": 3,
        "total_messages": 3
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### System Message Characteristics

- **Message Type**: `system` (distinct from `user_message` and `openai_response`)
- **No Sender**: `sender_id` is always `null` for system messages
- **Metadata**: Includes sequence information and therapy response type
- **Content**: Therapeutic guidance, questions, and insights
- **Timing**: Appears 2 seconds after trigger condition is met

### Technical Implementation

- **Non-Blocking Architecture**: API responses return immediately while therapy processing happens in background
- **Error Resilience**: Therapy response failures don't affect main program step functionality  
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in OpenAI request queuing and rate limiting
- **Security**: Input sanitization and validation for all user content sent to AI
- **Pairing Requirement**: Only works for programs with accepted pairings

### Configuration

The therapy response system requires:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-for-therapy-responses
```

Without this configuration, the system will log warnings but continue normal operation without therapy responses.

);
```

**Message Types:**
- `user_message`: Messages posted by users in the pairing
- `openai_response`: AI-generated program content (legacy)
- `system`: Background therapy responses triggered by user interactions

## Password Requirements

Passwords must meet the following criteria:
- Exactly 8 characters long
- At least one number (0-9)
- At least one symbol (!@#$%^&*()_+-=[]{}|;':",./<>?)
- At least one capital letter (A-Z)
- At least one lowercase letter (a-z)

## Partner Code Format

Partner codes are temporarily generated when users request pairings:
- Format: `XXXXXX` (e.g., "ABC123", "XYZ789")
- Uses uppercase letters A-Z and numbers 0-9
- Generated only when requesting a pairing
- Valid until someone uses them or the request is cancelled
- No hyphens or special characters

## Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication:

- **Access Tokens**: Short-lived (1 hour) for API requests
- **Refresh Tokens**: Long-lived (7 days) for obtaining new access tokens
- **Bearer Token**: Include `Authorization: Bearer {token}` in request headers

## Error Handling

The API includes comprehensive error handling for:

- **400 Bad Request**: Missing fields, invalid email format, password validation
- **401 Unauthorized**: Missing or invalid access token
- **403 Forbidden**: Invalid refresh token, unauthorized pairing actions
- **404 Not Found**: User or pairing not found
- **409 Conflict**: Duplicate email, pairing already exists
- **500 Internal Server Error**: Database errors, server issues

## Development

To run the server in development mode with auto-restart:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The server will automatically restart when you make changes to the code.

## Example Usage

### Complete Pairing Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create two users (showing both full and minimal request formats)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "first_name": "John",
    "last_name": "Doe",
    "password": "Test1!@#",
    "max_pairings": 1
  }'

curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/users \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
    "password": "Test2!@#",
    "max_pairings": 1
  }'

# 2. Login as both users
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "password": "Test1!@#"
  }'

# 3. John requests a pairing (generates partner code)
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/pairing/request \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {john_access_token}"

# This returns a partner_code like "ABC123" that John can share

# 4. Login as Jane and accept the pairing using John's partner code
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
    "password": "Test2!@#"
  }'

    "partner_code": "ABC123"
  }'

# 5. View accepted pairings
curl -X GET http://localhost:9000/api/pairing/accepted \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {john_access_token}"
```

### Complete Program and Conversation Workflow

```bash

# 4. Add a message to day 1 conversation
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/programs/{program_id}/conversations/day/1 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}" \
  -d '{
    "content": "This is our follow-up reflection on day 1. We continue to feel more connected!",
    "metadata": {
      "follow_up": true,
      "satisfaction_rating": 5
    }
  }'

### Background Therapy Response Example

```bash
# 1. User 1 (Steve) posts first message to a conversation
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {steve_access_token}" \
  -d '{
    "content": "I feel like we have grown apart over the years. I miss the closeness we used to have."
  }'

# API responds immediately (non-blocking)
# Response: {"message": "Message added successfully", "data": {...}}

# 2. User 2 (Becca) posts first message to the same conversation  
curl -X POST http://localhost:9000/api/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {becca_access_token}" \
  -d '{
    "content": "I feel the same way. I want us to find our way back to each other."
  }'

# API responds immediately (non-blocking)
# Response: {"message": "Message added successfully", "data": {...}}

# 3. After 2 seconds, system automatically adds therapy response messages
# Check messages to see the system responses:
curl -X GET http://localhost:9000/api/conversations/{conversation_id}/messages \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {access_token}"

# Response will now include system messages like:
# {
#   "messages": [
#     {
#       "id": "user_msg_1",
#       "message_type": "user_message", 
#       "sender": {"first_name": "Steve", ...},
#       "content": "I feel like we have grown apart over the years..."
#     },
#     {
#       "id": "user_msg_2", 
#       "message_type": "user_message",
#       "sender": {"first_name": "Becca", ...}, 
#       "content": "I feel the same way. I want us to find our way back..."
#     },
#     {
#       "id": "sys_msg_1",
#       "message_type": "system",
#       "sender_id": null,
#       "content": "Thank you both for sharing your feelings with me. I can hear the longing in both of your voices for deeper connection.",
#       "metadata": {"type": "therapy_response", "sequence": 1, "total_messages": 3}
#     },
#     {
#       "id": "sys_msg_2", 
#       "message_type": "system",
#       "sender_id": null,
#       "content": "Steve, when you shared that you miss the closeness you used to have, what emotions were you experiencing in that moment?",
#       "metadata": {"type": "therapy_response", "sequence": 2, "total_messages": 3}
#     },
#     {
#       "id": "sys_msg_3",
#       "message_type": "system", 
#       "sender_id": null,
#       "content": "Becca, your response shows such openness to rebuilding that bond together. Can you help us understand what finding your way back means to you?",
#       "metadata": {"type": "therapy_response", "sequence": 3, "total_messages": 3}
#     }
#   ]
# }
