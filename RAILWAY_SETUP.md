# Railway Deployment Security Guide

## üîí Setting Up Environment Variables Securely

### Method 1: Railway Dashboard
1. Go to [railway.app](https://railway.app) and open your project
2. Click on your service
3. Navigate to **Variables** tab
4. Click **+ New Variable**
5. Add these variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret
   JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secure-refresh-secret
   NODE_ENV=production
   ```

### Method 2: Railway CLI
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm install -g @railway/cli

# Login to Railway
railway login

# Link to your project
railway link

# Set environment variables
railway variables set OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-api-key
railway variables set JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-jwt-secret
railway variables set JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your-super-secure-refresh-secret
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### ‚úÖ DO:
- Use Railway's environment variables for all secrets
- Use strong, unique secrets for JWT tokens
- Enable Railway's automatic HTTPS
- Monitor your OpenAI usage and set billing limits
- Use Railway's built-in database encryption

### ‚ùå DON'T:
- Put API keys in your code or `.env` files
- Commit secrets to git
- Share environment variables in public channels
- Use weak or default passwords
- Log sensitive information

## üîß Additional Security Features

### API Key Rotation
- Regularly rotate your OpenAI API key
- Update the Railway environment variable
- No code changes needed!

### Access Control
- Limit Railway project access to necessary team members
- Use Railway's role-based permissions
- Enable two-factor authentication

### Monitoring
- Monitor Railway logs for security issues
- Set up OpenAI usage alerts
- Monitor for unusual API patterns

## üö® Emergency Response

### If API Key is Compromised:
1. **Immediately** revoke the key in OpenAI dashboard
2. Generate a new API key
3. Update Railway environment variable
4. Redeploy if necessary
5. Monitor for unauthorized usage

### Railway Security Features:
